# spotifyclo
Spotify Clone (HTML, CSS, JS)  My first GitHub project! This Spotify web player clone, built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, solidified my front-end skills. I focused on semantic structure, responsive design, and interactive elements. It's a key milestone in my web dev journey and a practical showcase of core skills.
